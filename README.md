# Algorithmic Problem Solving & Competitive Programming

Welcome to my personal repository for competitive programming and data structures & algorithms (DSA) practice! 

As a Computer Systems Engineering student and Full Stack Developer, I strongly believe in the power of strong algorithmic foundations. Here, I document my journey of improving my problem-solving skills, optimizing code, and mastering data structures by tackling challenges from various platforms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is currently organized by the platforms I use for training:

* **`/codeforces`**: Solutions to Codeforces problems. These mostly focus on pure algorithmic thinking, mathematics, and time-complexity optimization.
* **`/leetcode`**: Implementations for LeetCode problems. This is my training ground for technical interview preparation, focusing on clean, efficient, and readable code.

##  Languages & Tools

* **C++**: My primary language for competitive programming due to its execution speed and the versatility of the Standard Template Library (STL).
